    Calcium imaging is inherently susceptible to detection noise especially when imaging with high frame rate or under low excitation dosage. However, calcium transients are highly dynamic, non-repetitive activities and a firing pattern cannot be captured twice. Clean images for supervised training of deep neural networks are not accessible. Here, we present DeepCAD, a deep self-supervised learning-based method for calcium imaging denoising. Using our method, detection noise can be effectively removed and the accuracy of neuron extraction and spike inference can be highly improved.

 <br> we present DeepCAD-RT, a versatile self-supervised denoising method for fluorescence time-lapse imaging with real-time processing speed and improved performance. By pruning redundant features inside the network architecture, we constructed a lightweight network and compressed the model parameters by 94%, which consequently reduced 85% processing time and 70% memory consumption. Meanwhile, we augmented the training data by 12-fold to alleviate the data dependency and make the method still tractable with a small amount of data. We show that such a strategy of combining model compression and data augmentation eliminates overfitting and makes the training process stable and easy to harness. Finally, we optimized the hardware deployment of DeepCAD-RT and achieved an overall improvement of a 27-fold reduction in running memory and a 20-fold acceleration in inference speed, which ultimately supports real-time image denoising once incorporated with the microscope acquisition system.
