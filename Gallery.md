*[Imaging calcium transients in dendritic spines of a mouse expressing genetically encoded GCaMP6f calcium indicator. One example frame is shown for the raw low-SNR recording (top), DeepCAD-RT denoised recording (middle), and synchronized high-SNR recording with 10-fold SNR (bottom). Magnified views of the yellow boxed region showing calcium dynamics of two spatially adjacent dendritic branches.]*

Bottom, high-SNR recording with 10-fold SNR. Magnified views show the neural activity of the yellow boxed region in a short period.]*

*[Denoising performance of DeepCAD on calcium imaging of Drosophila mushroom body (GCaMP6f). The same frame is shown for the original low-SNR data (left), DeepCAD-RT denoised image (middle), and high-SNR image with 10-fold SNR (right). Magnified views show snapshots of the yellow boxed region at three moments.]*

<center><h3>Denoising performance of DeepCAD-RT on neutrophil in 3D</h3><img src="https://github.com/cabooster/DeepCAD-RT/blob/page/images/gallery_NP.png?raw=true" width="600" align="middle"></center>



*[3D imaging of neutrophil migration in a 150×150×30 μm3 volume (15 planes) after acute brain injury. The raw noisy volume (left) and corresponding denoised volume (right) are visualized in the same perspective. Acute brain injury was induced with craniotomy. Neutrophils were labeled with a fluorescent-conjugated Ly-6G antibody (the green channel). Blood vessels were stained with A wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, the magenta channel) dye. Since blood vessels are stationary, the magenta channel was averaged by multiple frames to improve its SNR.]*

*[3D visualization of ATP-release events in a 350×350×60 μm3 volume (30 planes, 1 Hz volume rate) after laser-induced brain injury. Left, the raw volume without denoising. Right, the same volume enhanced with DeepCAD-RT. A representative time point is demonstrated here and similar performance was achieved throughout the whole imaging session (1 hour, 3600 volumes). Four ATP-release events are indicated with arrowheads of different colors. The laser-damaged point (red dashed circle) was located at the center of the volume. ]*
